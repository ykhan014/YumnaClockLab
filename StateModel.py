class StateModel:
    """
    A really simple implementation of a generic state model
    Keeps track of a number of states by sending the total number
    of states to the constructor. State numbers always start from 0
    which is the start state.

    Also takes a handler which is just a reference to a class that has
    three responder methods. The responder methods for stateEntered and
    stateLeft receives the state that was entered or left,
    with the event code that caused it. stateDo only receives the current
    state.
    
        stateEntered(state, event)
        stateLeft(state, event)
        stateDo(state)

    Currently there are 10 hardcoded events that are supported.
    
    * BTN1_PRESS/RELEASE through BTN5_PRESS/RELEASE are for button presses
    and releases - in the order they are created.
    * TIMEOUT is the event for a software or hardware timer. Only one
    timer can be active at a time
    * NO_EVENT is for non-event-related transitions. So if a state performs 
    the entry actions and do actions and then immediately goes to the next state, 
    NO_EVENT can be used. 

    The calling class or the handler must override stateEntered and
    stateLeft to perform actions as per the state model

    After creating the state, call addTransition to determine
    how the model transitions from one state to the next.

    As events start coming in, call processEvent on the event to
    have the state model transition as per the transition matrix.
